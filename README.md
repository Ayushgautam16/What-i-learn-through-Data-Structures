# 📚 What I Learn Through Data Structures  

Welcome to **"What I Learn Through Data Structures"** — my personal journey to master Data Structures in a **fun & engaging way** 🎮.  
Instead of the usual textbook style, I’ll be learning and sharing concepts **in game-format code** — because learning should be exciting, not boring!  

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Series
- Learn **core data structures** (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more)  
- Understand **how they work under the hood**  
- Build **mini-games or game-like simulations** for each concept  
- Share **code + explanations** so anyone can follow along

---

## 🕹️ How It Works
Each data structure will be represented **as part of a game**:
- **Array** → Inventory system in a game  
- **Stack** → Undo/Redo actions  
- **Queue** → Player turn system  
- **Linked List** → Character movement chain  
- **Tree** → Game decision-making (AI)  
- **Graph** → Map navigation  

Every post in this series will include:
1. **Concept Explanation** (in simple words)
2. **Game-style Implementation Code**
3. **Output & Visualization**
4. **Key Takeaways**
